# Python Best practices

## 1. Introduction to Python
Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.

### *1.1. Comparison to other languages ( [source](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_intro.asp) )*

- Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.
- Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.
- Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.

### *1.2. When do we use Python?*

- Quick data model transformations directly in a database (ESRI ArcPy toolbox)
	- Use FME for data translation workflows
- Database migrations (SDE) (including domainlists, attribute/spatial indexes, subtypes, etc)

## 2. Follow [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) Guidelines
*Which guidelines are must-haves to include in the wiki?*

## 3. Python version
3.6.5

*Which Python version is currently installed in all environments? (Asked Erik) Always use ArcGIS Python*


## 4. Naming convention (PEP8 based, [source](https://realpython.com/python-pep8/#naming-conventions))

| Type      | Naming Convention                                                                                                         | Examples                                 |   
|:----------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|-----------------------------------------:|
| Function  | Use a lowercase word or words. <br>Separate words by underscores to improve readability.                                  | function, my_function                    |   
| Variable  | Use a lowercase single letter, word, or words.<br>Separate words with underscores to improve readability.                 | x, var, my_variable                      |  
| Class     | Start each word with a capital letter. <br>Do not separate words with underscores. <br>This style is called camel case.   | Model, MyClass                           |  
| Method    | Use a lowercase word or words. <br>Separate words with underscores to improve readability.                                | class_method, method                     |   
| Constant  | Use an uppercase single letter, word, or words. <br>Separate words with underscores to improve readability.               | CONSTANT, MY_CONSTANT, MY_LONG_CONSTANT  |   
| Module    | Use a short, lowercase word or words. <br>Separate words with underscores to improve readability.                         | module.py, my_module.py                  |   
| Package   | Use a short, lowercase word or words. <br>Do not separate words with underscores.                                         | package, mypackage                       |   

## 5. Documentation in Python
Add the following snippet to the beginning of your Python script:
```
"""
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Name:				  Name of Py script
Purpose:			Purpose of Py scripts
Author:				User(ADM account)

Created:			Date of creation
History:			19/04/2022 cruzg: Initial version
											09/05/2022 cruzg: ....
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"""
```

###  *5.1. Functions & Classes*
When a function/class is created, add the following snippet at the beginning as documentation:
```
def TestFunction(Var1, Var2):
	"""
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	 Input, datatype, explanation:	
	 	Var1 (string): xxxx
	 	Var2 (numeric): xxxx 
		....
	 Output, datatype, explanation:
	 	Var3 (list): xxxx
		....
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	"""
	
	PythonCode
	
	return(Var3)
```

## 6. Python IDE
PyCharm 2021.2.1. (Community edition) with Python 3.6.x from ArcGIS Pro 2.2.x

Location of Python executable: "D:\Apps\ArcGIS\Pro\bin\Python\envs\arcgispro-py3\python.exe"
